# 3pt-shooting
NBA 3pt shooting is a vital aspect of any NBA team's offense. Besides the obvious advantage of giving your team more points than a 2pt shot, 3pt shots allow teams to stretch the floor. With several high-percentage shooters around the perimeter, there is more room on the interior for players with the ball to operate and find efficient shots. The best rim protectors, like Rudy Gobert, have to decide between leaving open deadly shooters or abandoning the interior, or paint, where they provide the most value.

With 3pt shooting being so valuable, being able to predict shooting development from year to year is quite important. Shooting performance from year to year can vary greatly, however. Understanding the factors that can predict a player's shooting in the next season would be quite beneficial for constructing a team. Contract decisions in free-agency, extension talks, or trade negotiations would greatly benefit from the knowledge that a player is likely to perform better, or perhaps worse, in the upcoming season.
